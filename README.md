# Bukkit Autospawn

A Plugin made for simple /spawn functionality. Players who join will be tp'ed to the coordinated set using `/setspawn`.
This is mostly used for e.g lobby servers, where players should always log on at spawn.

Made for 1.16.5 / Paper
(Spigot | Bukkit is untested, but could also work)
